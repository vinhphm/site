It’s been almost four months since my blog post about switching to Anytype for note-taking. Anytype is still great and has a lot of potential, but I keep finding it hard to get used to. I even moved back to Notion for a while and kept searching for yet another alternative in the meantime. And then, there was [Capacities](https://capacities.io).

At this point, I won’t try to justify my decision to move to Capacities. I think it’s simply that I vibe more with how Capacities looks and works.

<figure class="extended-pt">
  <div class="extended-wrapper">
    <Image src={capacitiesLight} class="img-light shadow-xl" alt="Capacities's main UI" />
    <Image src={capacitiesDark} class="img-dark shadow-xl" alt="Capacities's main UI" />
  </div>
  <figcaption class="text-center">
      Capacities's main UI
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Maybe you could give it a try and find out for yourself.
