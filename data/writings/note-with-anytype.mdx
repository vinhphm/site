Like many digital note-takers, I've explored the usual suspects - Notion, Obsidian, and countless other note-taking apps. While each has its devoted following and impressive features, none of them quite clicked with me. That changed when I rediscovered Anytype.

I'll admit, [Anytype](https://anytype.io) wasn't a stranger to me. During my initial quest for the perfect note-taking app, I'd given it a brief look. Back then, it was still finding its feet, and I moved on. But recently, feeling somewhat dissatisfied with Notion, I decided to revisit my options. This time, Anytype caught my attention in a whole new way.

## Anytype's approach

What grabbed me this time was Anytype's unique approach to data ownership. Unlike most note-taking apps that store your thoughts on their servers, Anytype is built on the principle of:

- **local-first** with crazy-fast loading times
- **peer-to-peer** with secure & decentralized sync
- **open code** that gives verifiable autonomy & security

## Features

I personally think Anytype is very versatile. It can be as simple as an Apple Notes alternative for quick jottings, or scale up to handle complex Notion-like workspaces, and everything in between. What I love about this flexibility is that you can start small and gradually discover more powerful features as you need them.

  </div>

For instance, I started using it just like I would use Apple Notes - quick thoughts, task lists, and random ideas. But over time, I found myself naturally exploring its more advanced capabilities. I created a reading list where each book automatically links to its author and genre, set up a simple project tracker, and even built a small database to manage my blog posts.

The beauty is that none of these features feel forced. Unlike some other tools where you feel overwhelmed by all the possibilities upfront, Anytype lets you grow into its functionality at your own pace. It's like having a simple notebook that can transform into a sophisticated organization system when you're ready for it.

## Conclusion

Though there are might be some small issues while using, Anytype has a lot of potentials and will improve over time. I have high hope for it and will definitely use it more.
