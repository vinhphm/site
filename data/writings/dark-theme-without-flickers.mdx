description: Fix dark theme flickering in Astro + Tailwind by applying theme styles to the right element.

You're using Astro with Tailwind and following [Tailwind's guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#with-system-theme-support) to add themes like dark and light with automatic detection. But sometimes you encounter flickering when the page loads in dark mode. This is called **FOUC**, and it's not pleasant. If you're struggling to fix it, this article might give you an additional solution.

## What is FOUC?

**FOUC** ([Flash of Unstyled Content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content)) is a common theming problem. You'll see the default theme (usually light) apply first, then switch to dark mode, causing the UI to flicker for a moment.

## The fix: Where you apply matters

Most solutions suggest putting the detection script in `<head>`, which makes sense logically. But sometimes that doesn't work, and you're still stuck with flickering. Here's the key insight: it's not just about **detecting** the theme—it's about **where you apply** it.

```javascript showLineNumbers=false
// Detection script in <head>
(function() {
  const theme = localStorage.getItem('theme') ||
    (window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches ? 'dark' : 'light');
  document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', theme);
})();
```

The script detects the theme and applies it by setting the `data-theme` attribute on the root `<html>` element. This means your theme-controlling styles (background, text color, etc.) need to be applied to `<html>`, not other elements like `<body>`.

Many developers habitually put these styles on `<body>`, which causes the flicker because the body loads after the head script runs.

## The solution in practice

```css showLineNumbers=false
/* ❌ This causes flicker */
body {
  @apply bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900 text-gray-900 dark:text-zinc-200;
}

/* ✅ This prevents flicker */
html {
  @apply bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900 text-gray-900 dark:text-zinc-200;
}

/* Body can inherit or have its own non-theme styles */
body {
  @apply font-sans;
}
```

## Final thoughts

FOUC in dark themes usually isn't a detection problem—it's an application timing problem. By ensuring your theme styles are applied to the same element your detection script targets (`<html>`), you eliminate the gap between detection and application that causes flickering.

This small change can make the difference between a jarring user experience and a smooth, professional theme transition. Remember: detect early, apply immediately, and target the right element.
